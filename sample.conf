# of a client connecting through the proxy. It can contain a comma+space separated list of IP addresses and works
# as the 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP header in similar scenarios.

# will be aborted if not successful. It includes time needed for name resolution.

# the server with the fewer active connections will be tried first.
